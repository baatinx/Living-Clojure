;; chapter 7 - Creating Web Applications with Clojure

1. If you are planning on creating an API where all the routes will be JSON, you are most
likely not going to manually craft the response on each of them. In this case, we can use
Ring middleware to automate this process for us. The Ring-JSON library does just this. It
will automatically convert any response with a Clojure collection as a body into JSON for
you, and it uses Cheshire to do it

2. It is good to remember that there are differences between Clojure and ClojureScript
although they do share core language structures and features. These are the major
differences to take note of:
    1. ClojureScript has JavaScript interop rather than Java.
    2. Although there are atoms, there are no agents or refs.
    3. In ClojureScript, only integer and floating-point numbers are supported.
    4. Of course, ClojureScript compiles to JavaScript.
